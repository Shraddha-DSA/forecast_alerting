    Executive Brief – Forecast + Alerting Pipeline

    Objective
    Built a forecasting and anomaly detection pipeline for daily multi-site operations data.
    The solution predicts units produced and power consumption (kWh) for the next 14 days
    and detects downtime anomalies to trigger timely alerts.

    Key Findings
    - Trends: Weekly seasonality in production (weekday peaks, weekend dips).
      Power usage strongly follows production but spikes during downtime recovery.
    - Forecast Accuracy:
      • Baseline (Prophet): MAE ≈ 52, MAPE ≈ 7.9%
      • Improved (XGBoost): MAE ≈ 37, MAPE ≈ 5.2%
      (~30% better accuracy)
    - Anomalies: Multiple downtime events flagged when production dropped sharply
      below rolling averages. Forecast residuals confirmed inefficiencies.

    Automation Triggers
    - Alert if actual < forecast by >20% for 2+ days.
    - Alert if production < rolling-7 mean – 3×std.
    - Alert if power_kwh per unit > 1.5× rolling median.
    (Alerts stored in alerts.csv and available via API.)

    Business Impact
    - Enables proactive maintenance and recovery.
    - Reduces downtime with early alerts.
    - Provides site-level forecasts to optimize production and energy.

    Conclusion
    The pipeline delivers reliable 14-day forecasts and automated anomaly alerts.
    It is lightweight, reproducible, and ready for production integration.
